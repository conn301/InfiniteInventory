# InfiniteInventory
Internship Project

This application allows a user to select an Excel Spreadsheet (in the proper format) and have it sent to a database. The database can then be viewed. As the database gets bigger, it will be harder to find information which is why the search feature is availiable. 


To install:

pip install kivy
pip install reportlab
pip install openpyxl
pip install elasticsearch
pip install xlrd
pip install python-docx --user
pip install pandas
